## Done
1. Did some progress on react learning on Udemy platform.
2. Started implementing 'Learning' widget component - with 2-side cards and carousel.
3. Added new colors for answer selection states to globals.css

## Problems
1. While implementing 2-side card for 'Learning' widget - I was hoping to use react-card-flip for flip animation. But it appeared to be it's incompatible with React 9+.

## Solutions
1. I created custom flip animation with css instead of using react-card-flip.

## Plans
1. Keep learning (Udemy).
2. Working on the widget: Redo logic of 'Next' button on 'Learning' widget. Probably update ui for 'Learning' widget?
3. Think of the logic on how to return the result of the question to the widget engine?

## Time Spent
- 2-3 hours - react learning
- 6 hours - working on 'Learning' widget component
