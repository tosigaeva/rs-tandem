## Done
1. After our previous team meeting yesterday, we decided on brand color and general idea what to do the following week.
2. I started implementing landing page - basic page is done.

## Problems
- Tailwind is a challenge for me as I haven't worked with it before. As well as the idea of reactive programming - still new to me. Also I find it difficult to find cool ideas for landing page because we have no widgets yet and it's not clear for now what widget we'll manage to do.
- I had an idea with canvas animation for background for the landing page (bubbles on the background). But when I implemented it - I realized it looks stupid and removed it.

## Solutions
1. Reading tailwind documentation during development process. Experimenting a lot with class names to see how each class changes the layout.
2. I have an idea of 3d animation for user interaction, but we'll see if I manage to implement it next week.

## Plans
1. Learn about 3d and try to implement some 3d feature that user can interact with (some 3d model that starts animation on user interaction) - for landing page.

## Time Spent
- 1 hour meeting  
- Being confused, reading / watching about react and next.js - 4-5 hours?
- 3 hours for basic landing page while fighting tailwind
- 1 hour - searching for 3d model that can be implemented on landing page for interactivity
