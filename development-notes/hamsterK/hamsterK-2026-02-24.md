# Date – 2026-02-24

## Done
1. Basic landing page implemented
2. During the implementation, I experimented with next.js, tailwind, animations (framer-motion), 3d effects (played around with basic three.js)
2. I started learning react from scratch to not miss any fundamental knowledge required for future development

## Problems
1. I don't have experience with React / Next.js, so I need to go through some course to catch up on basics.
2. We need to think of data contracts for our widgets

## Solutions
1. I will follow React course on Udemy for now to catch up on basics before continuing. 
2. During our meeting today, we agreed to think what widgets we want to implement and what data format is needed for that. Deadline - thursday, and then we can discuss it during the meeting on friday.

## Plans
1. React course on Udemy.
2. Plan work on widgets (which ones I want to implement + decide on contracts)
3. Probably I'll also do a 404 page.

## Time Spent
- 0.5 hour meeting  
- React course yesterday+today - 3-4 hours?
- 1-2 hours for experiments with 3d effects/animations
