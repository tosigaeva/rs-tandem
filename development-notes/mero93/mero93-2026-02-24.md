- **Goal:**  issues 20,21. login page + auth via supabase

- **Problem:** past week I have been pre-occupied with another course project and my participation in this project has been limited. Besides, we are using stacks that I am not familiar with yet (NextJs, Supabase). Task is a simple one, but before I start implementing it, I should first get better understanding on what's best practices in these stacks and have clearer vision how project will evolve in future.

` **Resolution:** watched few videos on NextJS (mainly from youtuber Mosh, @programmingwithmosh), glanced through the official NextJS documentation, asked Gemini to highlight differences and similarities between NextJS and Angular architectures (I am familiar with Angular). I think, as of now, I have enough understanding to learn NextJS while doing this project. I have not yet read on supabase.

- **Time spent:** around 2-3 hours

- **Plan:** 
  1. get to know what is supabase, read on it's documentation, functionality and how to set up a project/implement new features, etc.
