- **Goal:** issues 20,21. login page + auth via supabase

- **Problem:** progress is slower than I anticipated. Also I was distracted by other tasks (preparation for interview). Supabase Auth integration is done, but I have to check if it works correctly.

- **Plan:** I want to finish Login page today. Specifically, I want to add Sign in, Sign Up forms. I also want to make form and input UI reusable.


    1.  Create validation object with Zod
    2.  Create input UI with area to display error messages
    3.  Create reusable form UI
    4.  Create form wrapper with action buttons
