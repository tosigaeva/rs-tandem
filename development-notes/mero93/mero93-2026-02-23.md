- **Goal:**  issues 20,21. login page + auth via supabase

- **Problem:** past week I have been pre-occupied with another course project and my participation in this project has been limited. Besides, we are using stacks that I am not familiar with yet (NextJs, Supabase). Task is a simple one, but before I start implementing it, I should first get better understanding on what's best practices in these stacks and have clearer vision how project will evolve in future.

- **Plan:** 
  1. watch educational videos explaining project creation in NextJs, architecture of framework, workflow, different components of it, etc.
  2. get to know what is supabase, read on it's documentation, functionality and how to set up a project/implement new features, etc.
